_Analysis of the Spread of Information and Infection_

COVID-19 has had a profound impact on lives worldwide, and researchers from multiple disciplines have been coming together to attempt the daunting feat of predicting what actions are best for slowing the spread of infection. In our paper (found [here](CS523_Project_3.pdf)) we present the results of an epidemiological model designed to compare the effects of different types of decision making, modeling isolation by the individual or by their community. Our results show that countries acting fast to close borders works especially well when the individuals within the country also try to isolate themselves from others, even if some individuals go against the guidelines occasionally. We also show by use of a toy model that when countries act to close borders early, the effect that the collective population has on a country reduces. 

All code used to generate the model and results from the paper can be found in the __Scripts__ and __TransferEntropy__ directories, along with here: https://github.com/judeter/Mathematics-of-Epidemics-on-Networks.git.
